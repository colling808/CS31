1. I had trouble programming the rates of texts from 201 to 400 and texts over 400. I kept overcharging because once I was over 400, I would charge both rates. However, I figured out that once the text messages were over 400, you either added $4.00 or $6.00, depending on the month. From there, I was able to run my program smoothly.
